    "To expand on notion of being able to reprsent objects (geometrically) using a single equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$\n",

    "In the previous topics we were able to define a line in 2D and a plan in 3D.   \n",
    "Question: How can we define a line in 3D?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degrees of Freedom  \n",
    "This provides a way to determine the dimension of a solution to a set of equations given any/or no Constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you have a point in 3D space you haven't paced any limitations, however if you produce an equation such as $f(x,y,z) = 0$  \n",
    "then you have limited this point to the plane in which the equation is satisfied (this can still be many \"options/solution\" but less thn no constraint).\n",
    "\n",
    "We formalise the notion as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$Degrees \\ of \\ Freedom = dim(Space) - Num\\ Equations$  \n",
    "So with a point in 3D space with no constraints (no equations) has  \n",
    "$Degrees \\ of \\ Freedom = dim(\\R^3)$ - $0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now we constrain the space (3D) by two equations which also satisfy another but aren't parallel:  \n",
    "$a_1x + b_1y + c_1z + d_1 = 0$  \n",
    "$a_2x + b_2y + c_2z + d_2 = 0$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the intersection of 2 planes in 3D produces a line. This is consistent with the definition of Degrees of freedom.  \n",
    "So we could represent a line in 3D using two equations which satisfy another.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take this one step further.\n",
    "Suppose now we constrain the space (3D) by 3 equations which also satisfy another but aren't parallel:  \n",
    "$a_1x + b_1y + c_1z + d_1 = 0$  \n",
    "$a_2x + b_2y + c_2z + d_2 = 0$  \n",
    "$a_3x + b_3y + c_3z + d_3 = 0$\n",

    "The Degrees of Freedom is a single point however, this doesn't necessarily mean that only 1 point will exists. It only provides the dimension of the set of solutions.\n",
